Work environment : 
-----------------
jupyter Notebook. we use sqlachemy to connect python base environment with our RDMS (SQLite in this case)

============================ ==========================

For the Advanced_SQL file the work environment is IBM DB2 cloud database. that's why we have a separate file for the same dataset. There, we perform some operations such as :
	
	- Joins 
	- Creation of View
	- Creation of Stored procedure
	- Creation of Transaction
